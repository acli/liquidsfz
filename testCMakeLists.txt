# since on some platforms (windows) automake is not easy to use, this is an
# experimental file to use cmake as build system
#
#  - this just builds the shared library (no jack client, no lv2 plugin)
#  - shared library version is probably not compatible with automake
#
# do not use this on Linux/macOS/*BSD
