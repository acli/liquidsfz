- *silence
- key switches (details: sw_down, sw_up)
- envelope minimum times (prevent clicks)
- implement better interpolation (windowed sinc, bandlimited interpolation)
- possibly contstrain parameters (however, sforzando doesn't always constrain either)

- fix SampleBufferVector: should clear the vector before deleting messages on reload
- SampleCache::Entry should probably be class Sample
- may want to optimize sample cache buffer scan to avoid extra work for scanning meaningless entries
- make preload duration time configurable
- make foreground playback (offline rendering) available
- preload amount should depend on offset
- make preload / full load selectable via api
- maybe eliminate rbtree iteration (performance)
- make playhandle point to float rather than data object
- unload should be a bit later

- fix interpolation for samples close to loop boundary
- make quality configurable
- implement voice killing

maybe:
- aria xml index
- maintain active voice list
- implement sustain loop
