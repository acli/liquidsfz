- key switches (details: API, sw_down, sw_up)
- export sw_label and label_keyN in API
- provide midnam support for LV2 (controllers, switches, key labels)
- convert hydrogen note names to key labels
- envelope minimum times (prevent clicks)
- C++ style block comments
- implement better interpolation (windowed sinc, bandlimited interpolation)
- possibly contstrain parameters (however, sforzando doesn't always constrain either)

maybe:
- aria xml index
- maintain active voice list
- implement sustain loop
